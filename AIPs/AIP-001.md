## Summary: What is an AIP?
AIP stands for Arrow Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a design document providing information to the Arrow community or describing a new feature for Arrow. We intend for AIPs to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features and documenting the operational and organizational improvements of Arrow DAO.

The precise format for AIPs is detailed below, and a template is located [here](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIP-template.md)

Only AIPs in the “Final” state are eligible for adoption and must be reviewed by editors before marked as “Final”. If you want to contribute to an existing “Draft” AIP, coordinate with the original author(s) to submit a PR. If you want to work on a new AIP, contact any of the AIP editors listed [here](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIPs/AIP-003.md)

**The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.**

## AIP Work Flow

### Shepherding an AIP
Parties involved in the process are you (i.e. the champion or AIP author), the AIP Editors, and the Arrow community.

Before you begin writing a formal AIP, you should vet your idea. Ask the Arrow community on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/arrow) or [DAO Forum](https://dao.arrowair.com/c/arrow-improvement-proposals) first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research. 

It is highly recommended that a single AIP should contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the AIP, the more successful the ensuing process tends to be. Template for new AIPs is available [here](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIP-template.md).

Once the idea has been vetted, your next responsibility will be to present a Draft AIP to the Arrow community to begin the first tracked stage of the AIP process. This draft can exist as a work in progress by the Author and can remain in an incubation state if the idea or implementation needs to be developed further. Once the document is mature and ready for wider community feedback it goes to the Review stage i.e. ready for review/constructive feedback.

During the review stage more collaborative editing can occur based on feedback from the wider community. At the end of the review stage it is advised to conduct an informal poll to gauge if there is positive sentiment around the AIP document as it currently exists.

If the sentiment poll result is positive and all feedback has been considered, AIP Editors will announce a Last Call for the AIP. The Last Call stage is the community's last chance to suggest amendments to the proposal document.

If new substantial changes are suggested and require further discussion, the document should move back to Review. If no substantial changes are required, the document will be ready for token voting at the end of the Last Call period.

The snapshot vote will be created by AIP Editors along with vote text according to [these template headings](#snapshot-vote-text).

If the vote is passed, AIP Editors change the AIP's status to 'final' or 'living'. If the vote does not pass, AIP Editors will give the document a status of 'stagnant' (if no longer being actively worked on) or 'draft' (if it is still being worked on).

### AIP Process

The following is the standardization process for all AIPs:

**Draft** - The first tracked stage of an AIP in development. A Draft AIP is merged by an AIP Editor into the AIP repository once properly formatted.

**Review** - Reached once an AIP Author marks an AIP as ready for Review. This period is concluded with a community sentiment poll, prior to inclusion in the AIP repo and final token vote to affirm implementation.

**Last Call** - a short period where AIP document is prominently displayed as the final proposal that will be voted on if no substantial changes are requested.

**Final** - A Final AIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated for spelling or grammar corrections and additional context, not for consequential changes. 

**Stagnant** - Any AIP in Draft or Review which is inactive for too long is moved to Stagnant. An AIP may be resurrected by simply requesting this status change from an [AIP Editor] (link)

**Withdrawn** - The AIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed AIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this AIP number. If the idea is pursued at a later date it is considered a new proposal.

**Living** - A special status for AIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably AIP-001 (AIP Purpose & Guidelines).

**Obsolete** - An Obsolete AIP has been replaced, superseded or removed.
Only Final and Living AIPs are eligible for official adoption.

## AIP Templates and Formats

### AIPs
AIPs should be written in markdown format. AIP Template available [here](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIP-template.md)

### AIP Header Preamble

Each AIP must begin with a header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (---). This header is also termed “front matter” by Jekyll. The headers must appear in the following order.

`AIP`: AIP number (this is determined by the AIP editor)

`title`: The AIP title is a few words, not a complete sentence

`description`: The AIP description, in one or two short sentences.

`author`: The list of the author’s or authors’ name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.

`discussions-to`: The url pointing to the official discussion thread on dao.arrowair.com

`status`: Draft, Review, Final, Stagnant, Withdrawn, Living, Obsolete

`type`: One of Operational or Informational.

`created`: Date of AIP  number assignment in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14

`withdrawal-reason`: An optional sentence explaining why the AIP was withdrawn.

`vote-to`: If this AIP had a concluded vote, the url pointing to the vote (e.g. snapshot url) For a Living AIP that has had a successful vote, this should be the address of the last "Passed" vote.

`vote-date`: If this AIP had a concluded vote, when that happened in yyyy-mm-dd format. For a Living AIP that has had a successful vote, this should be the date when the last "Passed" vote concluded.

`vote-result`: If this AIP had a concluded vote, the result of the ("Failed" or "Passed"). For a Living AIP that has had a successful vote, this should remain "Passed".

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

### `author` header

The `author` header lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the AIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the `author` header value is:

    Random J. User (GH: githubname | Discord: discordname) <address@dom.ain>

Authors are not required to provide a GitHub username, Discord tag, or email; however, at least one author must provide a GitHub username in order to get notified on change requests and to approve or reject them.

## Snapshot Vote Text

The following headings are recommended when creating the Snapshot vote text.

- Brief description of AIP
- Rationale
- Outcome if Vote Passes
- Outcome if Vote doesn’t pass
- Relevant Resource Links
- Discussion Links
- Link to the most recent version of this AIP in the AIP github repo.

## Linking to External Resources

Links to external resources **SHOULD NOT** be included. External resources may disappear, move, or change unexpectedly.

## Linking to other AIPs

References to other AIPs should follow the format `AIP-N` where `N` is the AIP number you are referring to. Each AIP that is referenced in an AIP **MUST** be accompanied by a relative markdown link the first time it is referenced, and **MAY** be accompanied by a link on subsequent references. For example, you would link to this AIP with `[AIP-001](AIP-001.md)`.

## Auxiliary Files

Images, diagrams and auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that AIP as follows: `assets/aip-N` (where N is to be replaced with the AIP number - e.g. 001, 099, 240 etc.). When linking to an image in the AIP, use relative links such as `[Image Title](../assets/aip-001/image.png)`.

## AIP Editors

Current and historic AIP editors are recorded in [AIP-003](https://github.com/Arrow-air/dao-aips/blob/main/AIPs/AIP-003.md).

## AIP Editor Responsibilities

For each AIP, an editor does the following:

    Read the AIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.
    The title should accurately describe the content.
    Check the AIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style

If the AIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the AIP is ready for the repository, the AIP editor will:

    Assign an AIP number
    Merge the corresponding pull request
    Send a message back to the AIP author with the next step.

The editors don’t pass judgment on AIPs. They are necessary to do the administrative & editorial part.

## Style Guide

### AIP numbers

When referring to an AIP by number, it should be written in the hyphenated form AIP-X where X is the AIP’s assigned number (in a three-digit numerical format e.g. 001, 099, 240 etc.)

### RFC 2119

AIPs are encouraged to follow [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) for terminology and to insert the following at the beginning of the Specification section:

    The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## History

This document was derived heavily from Ethereum's EIP-1 written by [Martin Becze](mailto:mb@ethereum.org), [Hudson Jameson](mailto:hudson@ethereum.org), et al. which is in turn derived from Bitcoin’s BIP-0001 written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from Python’s PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Arrow Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Arrow or the AIP. Please direct all comments to the AIP editors.
