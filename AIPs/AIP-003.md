## Abstract
This informational AIP lists the active committees and roles within the Arrow DAO, gives a brief overview of their purpose, and provides links to further information. It also contains current and historic membership information for each of these committees and roles.

## Motivation
Currently, there is no overview of the active committees within Arrow, or their purpose. The community should be easily able to find information like committee membership and contributor responsibilities. This AIP will result in this information being presented in a more user-friendly way. Further, historical membership is not being recorded in a structured way outside of the committees themselves.

## Maintaining Records
The intention is for this AIP to contain records about all active committees. For this reason, if any future committees are approved by the DAO, they should be added to this record by the AIP Editors.
