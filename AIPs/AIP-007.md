## Abstract

This informational AIP lists active and historical projects within Arrow DAO, along with a description, named leader, and funding information for each of them as required by AIP-006.

## Motivation

Paired with AIP-006, this AIP will allow the Arrow community to keep track of and govern over projects within the DAO. This list will serve as a single source of truth for project and their statuses.

## Projects
