## AIP Types
AIPs are separated into a different types.

**Operational** - Describes a change that affects the day-to-day operations for Arrow DAO contributors or any of its Pods.

**Governance** - Improvements related to the governance of Arrow DAO.

**Informational** - Provides general information or guidelines to the Arrow community.

**Protocol** - Improvements relevant to protocol design or which require core contract changes.

## AIP Statuses
**Draft** - The first tracked stage of an AIP in development. A Draft AIP is merged by an AIP Editor into the AIP repository once properly formatted.

**Review** - Reached once an AIP Author marks an AIP as ready for Review. This period is concluded with a community sentiment poll, prior to inclusion in the AIP repo and final token vote to affirm implementation.

**Last Call** - a short period where AIP document is prominently displayed as the final proposal that will be voted on if no substantial changes are requested.

**Final** - A Final AIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated for spelling or grammar corrections and additional context, not for consequential changes. 

**Stagnant** - Any AIP in Draft or Review which is inactive for too long is moved to Stagnant. An AIP may be resurrected by simply requesting this status change from an [AIP Editor](https://www.github.com/arrow-air/dao-aips/aip-003.md).

**Withdrawn** - The AIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed AIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this AIP number. If the idea is pursued at a later date it is considered a new proposal.

**Living** - A special status for AIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably [AIP-001](https://www.github.com/arrow-air/dao-aips/aip-003.md) (AIP Purpose & Guidelines).

**Obsolete** - An Obsolete AIP has been replaced, superseded or removed.
